        "I‚Äôm fairly new to web development, and while the concepts seem fairly simple, getting the AssemblyAI web sockets to play with newer APIs is harder than I thought.\n" +
        "Especially when the documentation is flat-out wrong/outdated. I guess that‚Äôs why I do these things.\n" +

        "I expect to be told I‚Äôm crazy. If/when that happens, I hope they (at least) include valuable information about why they think so.\n" +
        "I may be ‚Äútechno-religious‚Äù. I believe the only way to fix the problems throughout humanity is creating super-intelligent AI -\n" +

        content: 
        "I suspect people will be more likely to want to go to in-person events such as concerts and theater performances in the near future due to the dehumanization of media. " +
        "AI entertainment will be huge, but its overuse will push people to want to see actual people perform in front of them so they can have that connection with the content. " +
        "I've been thinking of ways for live performers of all skill levels to be able to organize and promote their work. Maybe something like performance conventions where there " +
        "are several stages, like giant exhibit booths separated by curtains where people can see any type of show they want? I don't know.\n" +
        "<br>" +
        "<br>" +
        "I've been working out the concept of an idea I had that I call \"Phax\". Essentially, it's a way for AI assistants to communicate over phone calls for them to transmit " +
        "data more efficiently. I'm imagining a world in which LLM-based assistants make and receive phone calls, both as personal assistants and as support agents. It would be " +
        "better if they didn't \"talk\" using voice, but rather transmit data tonally, somewhat like fax machines or dial-up internet. The recipient agent could play three short beeps " +
        "before the beginning of the call, which could serve two purposes. It could let humans know they're talking to an AI, and let AI agents know they can respond with handshake " +
        "tones. They could then negotiate the parameters of the line, and data transmission could be established. What would take 5 minutes over a voice interface could be " +
        "accomplished in less than 30 seconds, even faster if on a digital VoIP line. I guess the most difficult part is standardizing the API for integration on both sides of " +
        "the call and convincing the platforms to implement the code universally. So far, it's just a few pages of notes and a routine daydream, but I'm fond of the idea.\n" +
        "<br>" +
        "<br>" +
        "A spider weaves a web, a complex structure built from its natural urge to do so. It isn't taught, it doesn't learn. It builds the web because it knows how and needs " +
        "to know how to in order to eat and survive. Understanding this, I think it's fair to claim that no neurological system starts at zero. A person completely deaf and blind " +
        "will learn how to walk even if they aren't able to observe others doing it. The instantiated structure of naturally occurring neurological systems has evolved with a " +
        "latent ability to perform actions. With future AI, we should hope to find ways to construct shapes in latent space that allow for the construction of these models " +
        "efficiently within the network. How can we build an evolutionary system that simulates this? I've been exploring this idea as it relates to the Conscious Effort Project.\n" +
        "<br>" +
        "<br>" +
        "I view having ADHD as both a blessing and a curse. The ability to take on the world and get nothing done simultaneously is a dreadful existence. I hate that I don't " +
        "finish projects then start a new one to fool myself into thinking I'm being productive. The IDK app/project is the latest example. I've spent a few weeks banging my " +
        "head against a wall, trying to get this simple thing to just work. All of the gears move independently but any time I try to fit them together, it locks up, motionless. " +
        "It makes me want to give up and move on to the next thing. The next idea.\n" +
        "<br>" +
        "<br>" +
        "Anyway, there are my rambles for the week. My wife and I are about to have a newborn soon, so hopefully I'll still have the brain space to keep up with these projects " +
        "during the adjustment period. Being a father is tough but I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world. After all, children are the future. -Daniel",

        "I strongly believe that human consciousness arises from the depth of our temporal perception, forward and back. I've written several dozen pages of speculation on the phenomena " +
        "known as consciousness based on various cognitive science concepts. All of my pondering comes back to the same conclusion that consciousness is derived from a latent 'sense' " +
        "of time. Like a dog's highly tuned hearing ability, we have high temporal awareness. The human cognitive model knows what it is because it strongly knows what it was, what " +
        "it currently is, and what it could be given a set of circumstances. It knows that it can manipulate states in the present to alter the future based on experience with the " +
        "past. Agriculture is the best example of this deeper temporal awareness. Humans had to understand that plants grow in this pattern over time, and if they caused more to grow " +
        "now, the future would be secure when the cycle repeats. Many animals are also conscious in this way, but humans have a distinct sense of the passage of time.\n" +
        "<br>" +
        "<br>" +
        "I feel proud of myself this week. I made significant progress on the I Do Know project. It's actually somewhat functional now, despite the out-of-date documentation on the " +
        "transcription API. I still have quite a lot to do to make it into an MVP, but now that it's functional, the rest is mostly aesthetic and UX refinement. I'm considering " +
        "implementing a trial credits system for users, or maybe a freemium model. For now, I'm going to keep it free until I work out most of the bugs. It's very unfinished right " +
        "now, but you can check it out at idoknow.info.\n" +
        "<br>" +
        "<br>" +
        "CrewAI (an agentic LLM framework) has released significant updates over the last few weeks, so I've been having fun trying out different ideas. When it comes to these agent " +
        "frameworks, I think their value lies in being able to use different models for different tasks - especially with local models. Google's (yeah, I know) Gemma 2 is very underrated.\n" +
        "<br>" +
        "<br>" +
        "I might apply to Y-Combinator with the Conscious Effort project. I seriously doubt I would be accepted, but it's worth a shot. My lack of a high-end education, coupled with " +
        "not having a co-founder (yet), is a valid concern. I probably wouldn't invest in the business at this stage either, so I can definitely understand why it would be a \"no\". " +
        "If you're reading this as a prospective co-founder: Hi, I would love to have you as a teammate to fix the world. :) My mother always told me not to worry about " +
        "all the problems in the world - that there's nothing I can do about it anyway. I'm going to prove her wrong.\n" +
        "<br>" +
        "<br>" +
        "I really want to give my kids a special Christmas, so I'm trying my hand at freelance software development to make some extra money. It seems like it'll be a pain to get my foot through the door on the " +
        "Upwork platform, but hopefully, I can find some cool AI projects to work on. If you're reading this and you need any AI or software-related work done, you can click here " +
        "to waive the client fee on Upwork. (Upwork link) I can do pretty much anything, and if I don't know it, I'll learn it.\n" +

        "Lately, I've been feeling restlessly excited with anticipation. Our baby girl is likely going to be born this week. I have a strange feeling it'll be on election night, " +
        "so I have something to actually look forward to. My wonderful wife is definitely ready to not be pregnant anymore. I couldn't imagine getting kicked under the ribs from " +
